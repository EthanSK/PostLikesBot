## A scraper built in Typescript and Node.JS, using Puppeteer to automatically posts things you like from your facebook feed to your facebook page

### https://www.etggames.com/post-likes-bot (the downloads on this page are outdated, please build from source for the latest version)

I use it to auto post memes I like to my meme page, but you can like any type of post for any type of page

## How to use it

First do `npm i && npm run build` (you need TypeScript installed)

Run it with `npm run start`

Or to develop, use `npm run dev`
